# Set up cloud function

## Initiate Firebase project

Assuming you already created a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) project, installed [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli), and [logged into your account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#sign-in-test-cli) - make sure you’re in the workspace’s root, and run this command:

```sh
% firebase init
You're about to initialize a Firebase project

? Which Firebase features do you want to set up for this directory? Press Space to select features, then Enter to
confirm your choices. Functions: Configure a Cloud Functions directory and its files

=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add,
but for now we'll just set up a default project.

? Please select an option: Use an existing project
? Select a default Firebase project for this directory: meu-starter (mmb-demos)
i  Using project meu-starter (mmb-demos)

=== Functions Setup
Let's create a new codebase for your functions.
A directory corresponding to the codebase will be created in your project
with sample code pre-configured.

See https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/organize-functions for
more information on organizing your functions using codebases.

Functions can be deployed with firebase deploy.

? What language would you like to use to write Cloud Functions? JavaScript
? Do you want to use ESLint to catch probable bugs and enforce style? No
✔  Wrote functions/package.json
✔  Wrote functions/index.js
✔  Wrote functions/.gitignore
? Do you want to install dependencies with npm now? Yes

i  Writing project information to .firebaserc...

✔  Firebase initialization complete!

## Adding the Library to Firebase Cloud Functions

Build the library into the functions folder.

So let’s edit `projects/shared/ng-package.json`, and change the destination folder:

```json
"dest": "../../functions/dist/shared",
```

Next, we need to tell the workspace the library's location has changed. Open the workspace’s root `tsconfig.json` and change the path:

```json
"paths": {
  "@meumobi/shared": ["./functions/dist/@meumobi/shared"]
},
```

Just to make sure we didn’t create any regressions, remove previous `dist` folder `rm -rf dist` and run `ng build shared`, then run `ng serve` again and confirm the log is still printed to the console.

Then, resources should be explicitly added to the `package.json`. So open `functions/package.json` and add this dependency:

```json
"dependencies": {
  ...
  "@meumobi/shared": "file:dist/@meumobi/shared"
},
```

And finish off with an npm install in the functions folder. This tells npm to create a symlink between `functions/dist/@meumobi/shared` and `functions/node_modules/@meumobi/shared`, which Firebase can easily handle.

```sh
% npm i --prefix functions
% ls -al functions/node_modules/@meumobi/shared
lrwxr-xr-x functions/node_modules/@meumobi/shared -> ../../dist/@meumobi/shared
```

And just to keep things clean, let’s tell git to ignore the dist folder:

```sh
% echo "dist/" >> functions/.gitignore
```

## ES Modules in Cloud Functions

By default cloud functions uses CommonJS modules while shared library we are importing uses ECMAScript modules.
Then we should [update cloud functions config to use ES modules](https://medium.com/google-cloud/es-modules-in-cloud-functions-f5be1676c8b5).
ESM can still import CommonJS packages, but CommonJS packages cannot import ESM packages synchronously.

### Set Type to Module

To enable ESM within a package, we must explicitly add the field `"type": “module"` to our `package.json` file.

### Use Import

Rather than using the `require` keyword, you may use `import` to load primitive, objects, and functions.

See below our `functions/src/index.js`.

```js
import { onRequest } from 'firebase-functions/v2/https';
import * as logger from 'firebase-functions/logger';
import { Profile } from '@meumobi/shared';

// Create and deploy your first functions
// https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started

export const helloWorld = onRequest((request, response) => {
  logger.info('Hello logs!', { structuredData: true });
  new Profile();
  response.send('Hello from Firebase!');
});
```

### Add ESLint config

Set up ESLint config for js files inside functions folder.

```json
{
  "root": true,
  "ignorePatterns": [
    "projects/**/*"
  ],
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": ["functions/**/*.js"],
      "extends": "eslint:recommended",
      "parserOptions": {
        "ecmaVersion": "latest",
        "sourceType": "module"
      }
    },
    {
      "files": [
        "*.ts"
      ],
...
}
```
